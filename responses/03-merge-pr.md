## Step 3: Merge Your Pull Request! 🎊

You're at the finish line! Time to merge your changes and complete the development workflow.

### 🎯 Your Final Mission

Merge your Pull Request and clean up your branches to complete the exercise.

### 📋 Instructions

**Using GitHub MCP in VS Code:**

Ask GitHub Copilot to:
1. **Merge the Pull Request** into `main`
2. **Delete the hotfix branch** (both locally and remotely) after merging
3. **Switch back to main branch** and pull the latest changes

**Example prompt for Copilot:**
```
Can you merge my pull request into main, delete the hotfix branch 
locally and remotely, and switch back to the main branch?
```

### ✅ What Should Happen

When you merge:
- 🔀 Your CSS fix will be merged into `main`
- ✅ The linked issue will automatically close (thanks to `Fixes #` in your PR!)
- 🧹 Your hotfix branch should be deleted to keep the repo clean
- 🏠 You'll be back on the `main` branch with the fix applied
