## ❌ CSS Link Still Has Issues

I checked your `index.html` file, and it looks like the CSS link still isn't correct.

### 🔍 What I'm Looking For

The file should have:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

But it currently has:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styls.css">
```

### 💡 How to Fix This

1. Open `index.html` in VS Code
2. Find line 7 with the CSS link
3. Change `href="styls.css"` to `href="styles.css"`
4. Save the file
5. Commit and push your changes

Once you push the corrected file, I'll automatically check again!
