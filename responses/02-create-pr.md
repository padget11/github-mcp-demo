## Step 2: Create a Pull Request 🔀

Awesome work fixing the CSS bug! Now it's time to get your changes reviewed and merged using a **Pull Request (PR)**.

### 🎯 Your Mission

Create a Pull Request to merge your fix into the `main` branch, following professional development practices.

### 📋 Instructions

**Using GitHub MCP in VS Code:**

Ask GitHub Copilot to help you:
1. **Create a Pull Request** from your current branch to `main`
2. **Write a descriptive title** like "Fix CSS stylesheet link typo"
3. **Link to the original issue** in the PR description using `Fixes #<issue-number>` or `Closes #<issue-number>`

**Example prompt for Copilot:**
```
Can you create a pull request from this branch to main? 
Title it "Fix CSS stylesheet link typo" and include "Fixes #X" 
in the description where X is the issue number for the CSS bug.
```

### ✅ Success Criteria

Your PR should:
- Merge your hotfix branch → `main` branch
- Have a clear, descriptive title
- Include `Fixes #<number>` or `Closes #<number>` in the description to auto-link the issue
- Contain the CSS fix (changing `styls.css` to `styles.css`)
