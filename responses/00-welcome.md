## Welcome to the GitHub MCP Workflow Exercise! 🎉

This is a **hands-on learning experience** where you'll discover how to **use GitHub Copilot with MCP tools** to streamline your entire development workflow.

### 🎯 What You'll Learn

This exercise teaches you how to **prompt Copilot** to:
- 🔍 Investigate and diagnose code issues
- 🌿 Create branches using git commands
- 🛠️ Make code fixes and commits
- � Create GitHub issues via MCP tools
- 🔀 Create Pull Requests via MCP tools
- ✅ Complete the full DevOps cycle from VS Code

### 🧠 The "AI as a Tool" Approach

This demo showcases **human-guided AI workflows** where:
- **You direct** Copilot through each step with specific prompts
- **Copilot executes** the technical tasks using MCP tools
- **You maintain control** over the workflow decisions
- **You learn** how to effectively prompt AI for development tasks

### 🐛 The Challenge

This World Clock application has a **critical styling bug** - the CSS isn't loading! You'll use Copilot to:
1. Investigate what's wrong
2. Fix the bug
3. Create an issue
