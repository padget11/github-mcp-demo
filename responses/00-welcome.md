## Welcome to the GitHub MCP Workflow Demo! 🎉

Congratulations on starting this interactive exercise! You're about to learn how to use **GitHub MCP (Model Context Protocol)** with **VS Code Copilot** to streamline your entire development workflow - from discovering bugs to deploying fixes.

### 🎯 What You'll Learn

In this hands-on exercise, you'll:
- 🔍 Use AI to investigate and diagnose code issues
- 📝 Create GitHub issues directly from VS Code using MCP tools
- 🌿 Implement proper Git branching strategies for hotfixes
- 🛠️ Fix bugs with AI-assisted code changes
- 🔀 Create and manage Pull Requests through MCP
- ✅ Complete the full DevOps cycle from bug to deployment

### 🐛 The Challenge

This World Clock application has a **critical styling bug** - the CSS isn't loading! Your mission is to find and fix the issue using GitHub MCP tools, following professional development workflows.

### 🚀 Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ VS Code with GitHub Copilot extension installed
- ✅ GitHub MCP Server configured and running
- ✅ This repository forked to your account

**Your First Step:**

Open this repository in VS Code and start the GitHub MCP Server:
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
2. Search for `MCP: Show Installed Server`
3. Find **github** in the list, right-click, and select **Start Server**
4. Verify it shows as "Connected" or "Running"

Once your MCP server is running, **close this issue** and I'll guide you to the next step!
